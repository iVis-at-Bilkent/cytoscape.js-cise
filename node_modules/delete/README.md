> Delete files and folders and any intermediate directories if they exist (sync and async).

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save delete
```

## Usage

```js
var del = require('delete');

// async
del(['foo/*.js'], function(err, deleted) {
  if (err) throw err;
  // deleted files
  console.log(deleted);
});

// sync
del.sync(['foo/*.js']);

// promise
del.promise(['foo/*.js'])
  .then(function(deleted) {
    // deleted files
    console.log(deleted)
  });
```

## Options

All methods take an `options` object as the second argument.

### options.force

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

By default, error is thrown if you try to delete either the current working directory itself, or files outside of the current working directory (e.g. parent directories).

**Examples**

```js
del.sync('../foo.md', {force: true});

del('.', {force: true}, function(err, files) {
  // do stuff with err
  console.log(files);
});

del.promise('./', {force: true})
  .then(function(files) {
    console.log(files);
  })
```

_(This option was inspired by settings in [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).)_
